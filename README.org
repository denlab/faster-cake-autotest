* What's this? 

  A thin wrapper around =cake midje= that adds: 
    - Instantaneous detection of changes in the project using Linux's inotify.
    - Add color to output dependending on the success or failure of
      tests.

        [[https://github.com/denlab/faster-cake-autotest/raw/master/src/doc/image/autotest-emacs.png]]

* Install

  - Download the =cake-autotest= script, make it executable and put it
    in your path.

  - Of course you need [[https://github.com/ninjudd/cake][cake]].

  - You need =inotify-tools=, on Ubuntu: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
#+END_SRC
  - The script is using =cake midje=, so you need to add the Midje
    Cake plugin: To do that add [[https://github.com/marick/Midje/raw/master/examples/cake-midje/tasks.clj][this file]] to your the root directory
    of your project. More informations [[https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Cake-midje][here]].




* Issues

  - Probably don't work on other plateform than Linux (untested).
