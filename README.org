* What's this? 

  A thin wrapper around =cake midje= that adds: 
    - Instantaneous detection of changes in the project using Linux's inotify.
    - Add color to output dependending on the success or failure of
      tests.

* Install

  - Download the =cake-autotest= script, make it executable and put it
    in your path.
  - You need =inotify-tools=, on Ubuntu: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
#+END_SRC

* Issues

  - Probably don't work on other plateform than Linux (untested).
