#+STARTUP: indent

* What's this? 

  A tiny wrapper around =cake midje=, replacing =cake autotest=, it adds: 
    - Instantaneous detection of changes in the project using Linux's inotify.
    - Add color to output dependending on the success or failure of
      tests.

        [[https://github.com/denlab/faster-cake-autotest/raw/master/src/doc/image/autotest-emacs.png]]

* Install

  - Download the =cake-autotest= script, make it executable and put it
    in your =PATH=.

  - Of course you need [[https://github.com/ninjudd/cake][cake]].

  - You need =inotify-tools=, to install on Debian: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
apt-get install inotify-tools
#+END_SRC
  - Add the the [[https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Cake-midje][Midje Cake plugin]] to your project:
    - Add [[https://github.com/marick/Midje/raw/master/examples/cake-midje/tasks.clj][tasks.clj]] to your the root directory of your project.

* Usage 
  - Simply call: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cake-autotest
#+END_SRC
  - Instead of: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cake autotest
#+END_SRC

* Additionnal notes

  - I like to launch it an small Emacs window (like in the screenshot above).
  - So I always know the health of my project.
  - Because the red / green color are flashy, I don't even need to
    look at it: In the corner of my eyes I can 'feel' if everything is
    OK or not.
  - It also act as a reminder: When I'm interrupted in the middle of
    a task - usually in the middle of a failing test: 'red status' -
    when I come back to the project I can switch context back again by
    looking at the failing test.

* Issues

  - Probably don't work on other plateform than Linux (untestedâ„¢).
